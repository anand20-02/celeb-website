        <p>"A regular feature of Kohli's batting in his career has been the number of times he has remained unbeaten. In
            fact, in 81 T20I innings, the India captain has remained not out 22 times, which proves just how good he is.
            When it's Virat Kohli's days, he ensures he finishes the match and is right there till the end, irrespective
            of the format he is batting in. This is a special aspect about his batting"

            <h1>About Virat Kholi</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national
                team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the
                world.[3] He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian
                Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.</p>

            <p> Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few
                months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having
                played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI
                middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and
                shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[4]
                Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5]
                Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC
                World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>

            <p> Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy
                following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs
                captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number
                of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record
                for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket. Among
                Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I
                rating (897 points).</p>
